# foldSeekR

## Description

`foldSeekR` is an R package designed to streamline protein structure predictions via AlphaFold (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) and architecture comparisons via FoldSeek (https://www.foldseek.com). foldSeekR uses Uniprot accession ID's or FASTA files or strings to search structure similarities on AlphaFold. It uses FoldSeek to query the AlphaFold database for the most similar protein architectures to the protein structure of interest. It provides visualization of the protein of interest and the similar proteins with highlighted regions similar to the target protein.

`foldSeekR` was developed using:

```
R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20
Running under: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1
```

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bellabr/foldSeekR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("foldSeekR")
```

To run the shinyApp: 

``` r
runFoldSeekR()
```

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:foldSeekR")
browseVignettes("foldSeekR")
```

`foldSeekR` contains 3 functions in the current version.

- `pull_prediction` for pulling protein architecture prediction information from AlphaFold including sequential information.

- `pull_summary` for pulling protein summary information from AlphaFold including Uniprot information and structural information.

- `pull_url` for retrieving the links to downloadable data files (PDB, CIF, or mmCIF) for the specified accession.

- `available_databases` for retrieving the databases available to be searched for structure similarity.

- `ticket` for submitting a FoldSeek job and retrieving a ticket.

- `status` for checking the status of the job submission.

- `foldseek` for submitting a job, handling the ticket, and retrieving information from the search query.

- `cache_top_hits` for caching a number of top hits with respect to sequence similarity for later use.

- `clear_cache` for clearing the cache for a given accession thread.

- `visualize_prediction` for producing an interactive and colourful visualization of the protein of interest.

- `visualize_foldseeks` for producing an interactive and colourful visualization of the protein of interest compared to the cached top hits for similar proteins in structure. The visualizations are side-by-side and interact together, in addition to being colour-coded by each region of similarity to the target protein of interest.

Refer to package vignettes for more details.
